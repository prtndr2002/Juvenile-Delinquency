<h3 style="font-size:100%;">CHILDREN IN CONFLICT WITH THE LAW WHO COMMIT CRIMES SUCH AS RAPE OR MURDER</h3>
<div class="CHILDREN">
<p>The treatment given to the children in conflict with the law depends first on the age (if 15 years old or below or above 15 but below 18 years old); second on the act of discernment; and third on the penalty imposed on the offense committed.</p>
<p>If the children in conflict with the law are 15 years of age OR above 15 but below 18 years old at the time of commission of the offense, and found to have acted without discernment, the child is exempt from criminal responsibility regardless of the nature of the crime committed. However, if the child is above 15 but below 18 who acted with discernment committed an offense with an imposable penalty of more than six years imprisonment (as in cases of rape or murder), the law provides that the child shall undergo court proceedings. When brought to court, the child may be placed under suspended sentence and be subjected to rehabilitation programs.</p>
<p>The social worker prepares an assessment report on the absence or presence of discernment in the commitment of a crime. Using a set of tested and validated tools in assessing discernment, the social worker used the following as the bases for the report: (i) facts and circumstances surrounding the case (Rule 34 c.1); (ii) educational level and performance of the child in school (Rule 34 c.2); (iii) appearance, attitude and the child’s demeanor before, during and after the commission of the offense (Rule 34 c.3); and (iv)assessment of a psychologist or psychiatrist which the social worker may request.</p>
<p>The child in conflict with the law may even be confined, by court order, in a facility for minors, where children are made aware that inappropriate behavior on their part cannot go unpunished and that they must account for wrongful acts.Children do not go scot-free but must account for their acts in a child appropriate process under the juvenile justice system. Justice is not denied to victims of wrongful acts committed by minors. The victims and their families can and shall obtain justice through the Juvenile Justice system.</p>

<h3 style="font-size:100%;">TO MAKE THE LAW WORK THESE ARE SHOULD TO DO </h3>
<div class="SHOULD">
<p>The DSWD should continue to develop and conduct training programs for social workers and other service providers for the effective performance of their duties and functions under the JJWA. It should also establish and strengthen alternative placements of children below age of criminal responsibility in cases where parents, guardians or relatives of these children cannot be located.</p>
<p>The PNP should continue to conduct special training to its personnel in the management of children in conflict with the law and the proper observance of procedures as prescribed by the law.</p>
<p>The DOJ should continue to train the prosecutors with the assistance of the DSWD on child-sensitivity and gender-sensitivity. It should likewise continue to monitor the compliance of the Public Attorney’s Office, Bureau of Corrections, Parole and Probation Administration and National Bureau of Investigation with their respective duties and responsibilities under the law.</p>
